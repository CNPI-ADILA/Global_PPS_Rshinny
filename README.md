# 📊 AWaRe Quality Indicators – Inpatient Dashboard 

##### Overview 

This repository hosts the AWaRe Quality Indicators (QI) Inpatient Dashboard, including: 

- The R Shiny dashboard source code and prototypes 

- R Markdown source code and prototypes 

- Supporting documentation (User Manual, Interpretation Guides, Data Conversion Guide) 

- Relevant publications and resources 

The dashboard uses existing antimicrobial use (AMU) surveillance data, specifically Global Point Prevalence Survey (Global-PPS) data, to automatically generate AWaRe-based prescribing quality indicators. It supports antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) decision-making at hospital, national, and global levels. 

Although the dashboard is built on the Global-PPS data structure, a Data Standardisation (Conversion) Guide is provided to enable facilities using other surveillance systems (e.g. WHO PPS) to adapt their data and benefit from the dashboard outputs.
